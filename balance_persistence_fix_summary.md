# Balance Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
When a balance was edited and the schedule was regenerated, the edited balance was not persisting. The system was trying to modify past days to achieve future balance targets, which is unrealistic.

## Solution Implemented
The system now treats balance edits as new starting points for forward-only optimization:

### 1. **Balance Edit Tracking**
- When a balance is edited, it's stored as `balanceEditDay` and `newStartingBalance`
- The system only optimizes days after the balance edit

### 2. **Key Changes Made**

#### `identifyCriticalDays()`
- Now uses `effectiveStartingBalance` instead of original starting balance
- Starts analyzing from `balanceEditDay` if present

#### `generateChromosome()`
- Only generates shifts for days after `balanceEditDay`
- Adjusts work probability calculation for partial month

#### `evaluateFitness()`
- Uses `effectiveStartingBalance` as starting point
- Counts locked work days before balance edit

#### `formatSchedule()`
- Properly handles balance edit day
- Sets balance to edited value at end of edit day
- Preserves work schedule before edit day

#### `mutate()`
- Only mutates chromosomes for days after balance edit

### 3. **Debug Logging Added**
- Console logs when in balance edit mode
- Shows which days are being optimized
- Helps diagnose issues during development

## Test Results
✅ Automated test passes: Balance of $750 persists after regeneration
✅ System only optimizes days after the balance edit
✅ Past days remain unchanged as requested

## How It Works Now
1. User edits a balance (e.g., day 10 to $750)
2. System marks this as the balance edit point
3. When regenerating:
   - Days 1-9: Keep existing schedule unchanged
   - Day 10: End balance is set to $750 (the edited value)
   - Days 11-30: Optimize to meet bills and target balance
4. The edited balance persists through regeneration
