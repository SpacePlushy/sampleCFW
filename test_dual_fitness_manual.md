# Manual Test: Dual Fitness Function Fix

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
2. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Run initial optimization** with default settings
4. **Edit day 17 balance to $10**
5. **Click "Regenerate with Manual Edits"**
6. **Check console output for new messages**

## Expected New Console Output

You should now see messages like:

```
FITNESS BREAKDOWN - CRISIS MODE (13 work days, $2100.00 balance):
  Balance constraint violations: 0
  CRISIS: Below target penalty: 0
  CRISIS: Above target penalty: 161.0 (overshoot OK)
  CRISIS: Earnings shortfall: 0
  CRISIS: Safety violations: 0
  TOTAL FITNESS: 161.0

FITNESS BREAKDOWN - CRISIS MODE (5 work days, -$500.00 balance):
  Balance constraint violations: 0
  CRISIS: Below target penalty: 990500
  CRISIS: Above target penalty: 0 (overshoot OK)
  CRISIS: Earnings shortfall: 120000
  CRISIS: Safety violations: 0  
  TOTAL FITNESS: 1110500
```

## Key Success Indicators

### ✅ What Should Happen (Fixed)
- **Crisis mode detected**: Messages show "CRISIS MODE"
- **Low fitness for high work**: 13-work-day solutions have fitness ~161
- **High fitness for low work**: 5-work-day solutions have fitness ~1,110,500
- **Algorithm selects correctly**: Picks 13-work-day solution (lower fitness = better)
- **Final result**: 11+ work days, positive balance around $500+

### ❌ What Was Happening (Broken)
- Crisis mode triggered but...
- High-work solutions had fitness in billions (103B)
- Low-work solutions had lower fitness (24B)
- Algorithm incorrectly picked 5-work-day solutions
- Result: 5 work days, -$529 balance

## The Mathematical Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```
Both modes used: finalBalanceDiff * 20
13 work days → $2000 balance → |2000-490| * 20 = 30,200 penalty
5 work days → -$500 balance → |-500-490| * 20 = 19,800 penalty
Algorithm chose 5 days (lower penalty) ❌
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
Crisis mode uses asymmetric penalties:
13 work days → $2000 balance → (2000-490) * 0.1 = 151 penalty (overshoot OK)
5 work days → -$500 balance → (490-(-500)) * 1000 = 990,000 penalty (shortfall bad)
Algorithm chooses 13 days (lower penalty) ✅
```

## Testing Results

Please run the test and report:

1. **Console messages**: Do you see "FITNESS BREAKDOWN - CRISIS MODE"?
2. **Fitness values**: Are high-work solutions getting low fitness scores?
3. **Final schedule**: How many work days in the final result (days 18-30)?
4. **Final balance**: Is it positive or negative?

This will confirm if the dual fitness strategy successfully resolved the tug-of-war conflict!
